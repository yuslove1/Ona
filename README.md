![Ona Logo](public/danfo-icon.png) 

**Ona** is a mobile-first web application designed to simplify navigation for commuters, particularly students, and young professionals. It provides AI-generated public transport routes (danfos, kekes, BRT) and walking directions, with live map tracking similar to Google Maps. Users input their current location and destination (e.g., Ogba Bus Stop to Gbagada Phase 1) to receive step-by-step routes, including transfer points (e.g., Oshodi Underbridge), estimated costs (‚Ç¶150‚Äì‚Ç¶1,200), travel times (20‚Äì70 minutes), and Lagos-specific tips (e.g., ‚ÄúSay ‚ÄòOwa o‚Äô to alight‚Äù). Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and Leaflet.js, Ona uses free APIs (Openrouteservice and OpenStreetMap) for a zero-budget MVP, with plans for scaling using paid APIs.

Inspired by the hustle of Lagos and the developer's NYSC experience in Lagos, Ona brings a user-centric and local lingo. Perfect for navigating hubs like Ogba, Oshodi, Gbagada, and Iyana Ipaja e.t.c. üöç

## Features
- **AI-Driven Routes**: Generate dynamic routes with transfer points using Openrouteservice.
- **Live Map Tracking**: Real-time user location and route path display with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js, supporting ride (danfo, keke) and walking modes.
- **Country-Specific Details**:
  - Estimated fares: ‚Ç¶150‚Äì‚Ç¶1,200 (e.g., ‚Ç¶200‚Äì‚Ç¶400 for Ogba to Oshodi).
  - Travel times: 20‚Äì70 minutes with traffic-aware ranges.
  - Tips: Safety (e.g., ‚ÄúSecure phone in Oshodi‚Äù) and lingo (e.g., ‚ÄúSay ‚Äòmo n l·ªç si Gbagada‚Äô‚Äù).
